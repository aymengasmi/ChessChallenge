# Chess Challenge 

>>**The problem**


We aim to find all possible configurations of  chess pieces on a chess board of dimensions MÃ—N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others, assuming that the colour of the piece does not matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.


>>Input:

	-The dimensions of the board: M, N
	-The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.

>>Output:

The program should list all the unique configurations to the console for which all of the pieces can be placed on the board without threatening each other.
